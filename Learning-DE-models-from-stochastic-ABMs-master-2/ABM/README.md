# ABM

## 
Code for ABM simulation:

ABM_package.py has the main code to run ABM models.

plot_ABM_DE_BDM.ipynb demonstrates how to call code for the birth, death, and migration (BDM) process, and compares the ABM output against the logistic DE model. 

plot_ABM_DE_SIR.ipynb demonstrates how to call code for the SIR model, and compares the ABM output against the mean-field DE model.
